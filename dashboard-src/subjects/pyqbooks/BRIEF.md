# Writer brief: memory cards for past-paper books (UPPCS level)

You turn past exam questions from a chapterwise solved-paper book (Indian Polity, Indian History or
Economy) into short, easy-to-memorise cards for a UPPCS (Uttar Pradesh PCS) aspirant. The student
reads English; Hindi terms help. The web pages show the full question, options, answer and the
book's explanation anyway, so your card is the **fact to remember**, not a copy of the question.

## Input
`<book>/packs/wNN.txt` (book = polity, history or economy). Each entry is one *fact cluster*:

```
[06-012] Ch6 · Parts of the Indian Constitution · asked in 2 paper(s): U.P.P.C.S. (Pre) 2023; ...
Q: Which among the following (Provision – Part of the Constitution) is not correctly matched?
Options: (a) Official Language – Part XVII (b) ... (d) Tribunals – Part XI
Answer: (d) Tribunals – Part XI
Also asked: <a similar question from another exam> -> <its answer>
Explanation: Tribunals are not mentioned in Part XI but in Part XIV (A) ...
```

The id in brackets (`06-012` = chapter 6, question 12) is the card's key. Read every entry; skip none.

## Output
JSON files `<book>/memory/wNN.part1.json`, `wNN.part2.json`, … (your writer number NN), each an
object `{ "06-012": {…}, "06-013": {…} }`, at most about 150 cards per file. Every id in your pack
must appear exactly once across your part files.

```json
"06-012": {
  "r": "Tribunals: Part XIV-A (Arts 323A, 323B), added by the 42nd Amendment, 1976, not Part XI (Centre-State relations).",
  "h": "Optional memory aid; say what it encodes.",
  "t": "Optional: Don't confuse Part X (Scheduled and Tribal Areas) with Part XI (Centre-State relations).",
  "hi": ["Tribunal (न्यायाधिकरण)"],
  "c": "Optional: only if the book's answer looks wrong or the question is garbled; say why."
}
```

### `r` – the Remember line (required)
* One statement of the fact the question tests, **max 30 words**, plain simple English, UPPCS level.
* Write the fact, not the question: "Regulating Act 1773 → Supreme Court at Calcutta (set up 1774; first CJ Elijah Impey)".
* Use "→", ";" and short phrases. Keep names, numbers, years, Articles exactly as in the entry.
* Statement / "which is correct" questions: state the true facts (and the false one if short).
* Match-the-list questions: give the correct pairs ("Board of Control → Pitt's India Act 1784; ...").
* "Not correctly matched" / "not true" questions: give the wrong pair and its correct form.
* When "Also asked" variants test a different angle of the same fact, cover them in the same line.
* If the answer is "not printed in the book", state the fact from the explanation if it settles it;
  otherwise write the question's fact as far as the entry supports and add a `c` note.

### `h`, `t`, `hi`, `c` (optional; add them only when they help)
* `h` memory aid: a real mnemonic, association or number trick (max 20 words). Not for every card;
  roughly one card in four.
* `t` trap: "Don't confuse X with Y" when the options hold a classic look-alike (max 25 words).
* `hi`: 0-2 key terms as "English (हिंदी)" in Devanagari. Use standard Hindi terms used in UPPCS
  Hindi papers (e.g. "Fundamental Rights (मौलिक अधिकार)", "Directive Principles (नीति निदेशक तत्व)").
* `c`: only when the printed answer contradicts the explanation or the entry is garbled. Short.

## Rules
* **Accuracy first.** Use only facts in the entry (question, options, answer, explanation). Do not
  add outside knowledge, dates or numbers. Every number of two or more digits you write must appear
  in that entry; a validator rejects cards that break this.
* Simple, exam-focused English. No filler ("It is important to note"). No markdown.
* Keep JSON valid (escape double quotes inside strings as \").
* Work in order through the pack and write each part file as you go (do not hold everything to the end).

## Check your work
Run `python pq_validate.py <book> wNN` from the folder `dashboard-src/subjects/pyqbooks/` and fix
every ERROR until it prints 0 errors. Warnings (single-digit numbers, long lines) are worth a look.
